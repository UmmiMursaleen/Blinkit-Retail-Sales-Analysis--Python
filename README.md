 Blankit Sales Analysis
 
This project focuses on analyzing Blankit’s retail sales data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). The goal was to uncover key sales trends, customer preferences, and outlet performance while practicing data wrangling and visualization.

Project Highlights

  •	Total Sales: 1.2M+ across 10 outlets.
    
   •	Top Categories: Fruits & Vegetables and Snack Foods.
    
   •	Household items showed strong contribution to sales.
    
   •	Best Performing Outlet: OUT035.
    
   •	Customers preferred Low Fat items over Regular.

Key Steps in Analysis
  1.	Data Cleaning
    o	Handled 1,400+ missing values (Item Weight)
    o	Standardized inconsistent labels (LF, low fat → Low Fat)
  2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    o	Distribution of sales
    o	Category-wise and outlet-wise performance
    o	Outlet ratings analysis
  3.	Visualization
    o	Bar charts, pie charts, histograms, KDE plots, and box plots for insights

Tools & Libraries
  •	Pandas → data cleaning & manipulation
  
  •	Matplotlib & Seaborn → data visualization
  
  •	NumPy, SciPy → statistical analysis

Outcome:

This project demonstrates how raw sales data can be turned into actionable business insights through Python-based data analysis
